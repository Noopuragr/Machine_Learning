# Machine_Learning

This repository contains implementation of machine learning algorithms during academic cirriculum.

1. **Classification Algorithm**.
Basic ML Classification algorithm implemented on a shopping mall dataset to predict wether the user will buy product or not based on Gender, Income and Age.
